            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principles of A/D conversion are very simple. A digital signal is obtained by segregating a natural analog signal at regular intervals. The resultant discrete data can be expressed as shown in the figure below. When an analog waveform is discretized at regular intervals (red line), each data-point is converted to a digital value at time t. A computer performs various processes by storing such information in the central processing unit (CPU).

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our DNA analog-to-digital (A/D) converter reads concentration of input molecule and converts it to binary numeral such as 0 or 1 depending on the concentration of DNA. We designed A/D converter based on DNA parallel comparison type A/D converter in electric system by using DNA digital circuits. A/D converter has various methods such as “Double Integral Type”, “Successive comparison Type”, and “Parallel Comparison Type”.  Table1 shows element of each type and possibility in replacing DNA. We focused “Parallel Comparison Type A/D converter” in this time by considering possibility. It is difficult for us to design two types except for parallel comparison type because double integral type needs integrator and successive comparison type needs digital-to-analog converter. As for comparison type A/D converter, it is mainly consisted of logical circuits. For the above reasons, we decided to design DNA A/D converter based on Parallel Comparison Type A/D converter.

            <p>Step 1:
             <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown in Figure 3, we typically use resistances setting to regulate the input value in an electrical system. However, the DNA concentration in a DNA circuit system cannot be gradually reduced gradually in the case of a voltage divider. Therefore, we applied an Enzyme free device (1) from Tohoku University in BIOMOD2014. (<a href="http://teamsendai2014.github.io/">http://teamsendai2014.github.io/</a>) This device can generate different DNA strands in a given arbitrary order. We focused on two aspects of this device. Firstly, multiple outputs can be obtained from a single input and secondly, the initial transducer concentration is equal to the output DNA concentration. In our project, we applied this device to the production of molecules with a given concentration.In <a href="index3.html">dry experiments</a>, we generated six molecules with various reference concentrations (0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 nM).
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="text_temp">
            <p>Step 2:
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we compared the reference concentration generated in Step 1 to the input DNA concentration by using a <a href="#threshold_gate">threshold gate</a>. The threshold gate output was defined as “1” (high) when it exceeded 0.6 nM. Conversely, we defined outputs of less than 0.6nM, as “0” (low). This means that if the input DNA concentration was higher than the reference concentration, the output was “1”; otherwise, the output was “0”. For an input molecule concentration of 0.35 nM, the DNA strand was released from the top to the third gates through the threshold gate as “1”. Otherwise it was released as “0”.

        <div class="text_temp">
            <p>Step 3:
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we used <a href="#not_gate">NOT gate</a> and <a href="#and_gate">AND gate</a> to examine the “1” ““0” threshold from Step 2, which can indicate where the input DNA concentration corresponds to the reference concentration. As a result, “1” “”0” threshold was found to be the third AND -gate from the top-, with A4 being set to “1”.

            <p>Step 4:
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the DNA information from Step 4 was encoded through the encoder.
            As shown in Figure 4, the encoder consists of an <a href="#or_gate">OR gate</a>. In Step 3, A4 was set to “1”, and then x2, x1, and x0 became “1”, “0”, and “0”, respectively, through the encoder. We defined x2 as the most significant bit. Therefore, the conversion result was “100” in this case. This result corresponds to 0.3−0.4 nM in Table 2, and we could confirm that the input molecule concentration (0.35 nM) was converted to 3 bit.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A seesaw gate is based on a DNA strand displacement reaction, and it is possible to realize a logic circuit by combining this gate appropriately. The basic function of a seesaw gate is to compare an input signal to a set threshold. Then, if the input concentration is less than the threshold, the input signal is released. If the input concentration exceeds the threshold, the output is generated by DNA hairpin loops, which are used as fuel. The seesaw gate is composed of two DNA molecular reactions, the first of which is the threshold process. Figure 5 shows a model of the threshold process.

Moreover, the fuel and gate:input cause a strand displacement reaction, and the gate:input is replaced by input ssDNA and “gate:fuel”. This is because the gate:input includes T’, which combines with the fuel. The important aspect of this reaction is that the consumed input ssDNA is replenished by the fuel.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To realize a NOT gate, a structure including a DNA strand for output and an ssDNA called an “inverter” is required. An inverter has a complementary base input sequence. Therefore, the inverter reacts with input DNA by hybridization and obstructs strand displacement reactions, because the reaction velocity of hybridization is significantly faster than that of a strand displacement reaction.
            After reacting to the input, the inverter reacts to dsDNA, including the input toehold, using it as input to generate output.
            
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assume that the input concentration is sufficient. Therefore, the inverter is used to react with the input through hybridization and is consumed. The output generated by the inverter is relatively insubstantial. As a result, a low output is generated for a high input. Next, assume that the input concentration is insufficient. The inverter is consumed by a reaction with the input but, as the input has insufficient concentration, the inverter can generate a sufficient output concentration. As a result, a high output is generated for a low input.
            
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This description corresponds to the ideal behavior of a NOT gate. However, the NOT gate does not, in fact, function. Therefore, we focus on our simulation results for the NOT gate shown in Figure 12. We set the inverter concentration to 0.8x [mol].
            When a NOT gate is designed without a threshold gate, it can only function if the input DNA concentration is significantly less than the inverter. This is because a high output is generated for a low input (Fig. 12, left). However, the NOT gate cannot function when the input concentration is close to the inverter. This is because a high input produces a low output (Fig. 12, right).

            <p>As shown in Figure 14, we verified the functionality of the NOT gate for high and low w<sub><small>1,2</sub></small>. Figure 14, left and right, respectively. These two cases are discussed in more detail below:
            <br>(1). High w<sub><small>1,2</sub></small> (Figure 14, left).
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We define the input ssDNA w<sub><small>1,2</sub></small> and inverter concentration as 0.8x [mol]. Then, the output w<sub><small>2,4</sub></small> of gate2 is released as a high (0.6−1x) result, as the input concentration exceeds the threshold value 0.6x [mol]. Then, w<sub><small>2,4</sub></small> reacts with the inverter by hybridization. The higher the w<sub><small>2,4</sub></small> concentration, the greater the consumption of the inverter concentration. The consumed inverter concentration (0−0.2x) becomes the input of gate7, but it cannot exceed the threshold value. Therefore, w<sub><small>7,8</sub></small> is released as a low result. Hence, a low output can be obtained for a high input.
            <br>(2). Low w<sub><small>1,2</sub></small> is low (Figure 14, right)
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We define the w<sub><small>1,2</sub></small> input as 0.2x [mol]. Then, the output w<sub><small>2,4</sub></small> of gate2 is  low (0−0.2x), as the input concentration cannot exceed the threshold value 0.6x [mol]. The w<sub><small>2,4</sub></small> undergoes the same reaction as above, with the consumed inverter concentration (0.6−0.8x) becoming the input of gate7. Here, it can exceed the threshold value and, therefore, w<sub><small>7,8</sub></small> is released as high. As a result, a high output can be obtained for a low input.
              <br><br>Hence, the problem illustrated in Figure 12 has been overcome.

            <p>An AND gate releases an output ssDNA when both inputs are high, and the structure of this gate is shown in Figure 15. We prepare two seesaw gates (gate2 and gate4) including threshold gates. These include fuel provided by other gate outputs. The gate2 fuel is provided by output from gate4. Therefore, the output from gate2 is catalytic when both inputs (w<sub><small>1,2</sub></small> and w<sub><small>3,4</sub></small>) are high. Gate8 is a routing gate that can run from right side of one gate to the right side of another gate. Gate5 provides a signal to remove the stoichiometry trigger of gate2 when only input w<sub><small>1,2</sub></small> of gate2 is high.
            Figure 16 shows the result of the AND gate simulation, in which the following four cases were verified:

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An OR gate can also be realized by using a seesaw gate in conjunction with an AND gate, as shown in Figure 17. In this case, the seesaw gate has two inputs (w<sub><small>1,3</sub></small> and w<sub><small>2,3</sub></small>), which are compared by setting the threshold concentration to [0.5 nM]. If either input can exceed a threshold value, w<sub><small>3,4</sub></small> is released. However, if neither of the inputs can exceed this value, w<sub><small>3,4</sub></small> is not released and the inputs are removed as noise.<br>We verified the following two OR gate scenarios from the results shown in Figure 18:
            <br>(1)	Both w<sub><small>1,3</sub></small> and w<sub><small>2,3</sub></small> are low.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown in Figure 18, the output w<sub><small>3,4</sub></small> is low as the input concentration cannot exceed the threshold.
            <br>(2) Either input w<sub><small>1,3</sub></small> or w<sub><small>2,3</sub></small> is high.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown in Figure 18, the output w<sub><small>3,4</sub></small> is high as either input can exceed the threshold.
